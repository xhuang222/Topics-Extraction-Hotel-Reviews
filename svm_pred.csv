The guy I roomed with works in pest control and was a stickler about vermin bed bugs etc before we went and he had no complaints unlike some of our other guys who stayed elsewhere in the city so read into that what you will,"('ROOMS',)","('CLEANLINESS',)"
Exceeded our expectations!,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"

I would recommend the HHV only because I don't know how you could have a bad experience here.,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
Think Hilton quality and you will be pleasantly surprised!!,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
This place is away from the hustle and bustle of Honolulu.,"('OTHER',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
When we go back we will probably stay there to get some variety.,"('OTHER',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
We played the Ko'Olina golf course and it is well worth it!!!,"('OTHER',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
We also had the pleasure of going to a hotel called Ala Moana Hotel.,"('OTHER',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
Not on a beach but very elegant lobby.,"('BUILDING',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
No comment on the rooms as we did not see them.,"('ROOMS',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
If you go to Oahu whereever you stay you HAVE to eat at Aaron's in the Ala Moana hotel.,"('OTHER',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
The food is great but the service is incredible!,"('FOOD',)","('NOTRELATED',)"

"It was really cheap to stay here with lastminute, we paid 拢25 a night for our room!","('VALUE',)","('VALUE',)"

"You'll love it! This place is truly amazing! Yes, it is a bit out of the way for the Seattle hot spots in downtown, but that is what makes it extra special.","('OTHER',)","('BUILDING', 'LOCATION')"
It is really only a 10 minute drive from all the action.,"('LOCATION',)","('LOCATION',)"

The king bed was truly comfortable and our kids (5 and 10) stayed on the sofa sleeper and did not complain once.,"('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
We had a gorgeous view of Mt. Rainier out one side.,"('ROOMS',)","('LOCATION',)"
"There is also a microwave with a free popcorn package, a coffee maker, and a little refrigerator in your vanity area.","('ROOMS',)","('FOOD',)"

Just remember to GO EARLY.,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
By 9:00 the place was so crowded we were sitting on the couches to eat.,"('FOOD',)","('OTHER',)"
Not many tables!,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
We went at 8:15 and it was very nice.,"('NOTRELATED',)","('OTHER',)"
The hotel also has a mini general store right in the lobby and their mark-up on items was not bad at all.,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
I think they added about $.85 to a $1.90 quiche from the market up the street.,"('NOTRELATED',)","('OTHER',)"
"It is a GREAT little store with drinks, snacks, microwaveable meals, etc.","('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
We also partook of the FREE washer and dryer on every floor.,"('ROOMS',)","('OTHER',)"
That was awesome!,"('FOOD',)","('OTHER',)"
There isn't all that much around the hotel to walk to with the exception of Mamma Melena's up the street (excellent Italian food in a very relaxed setting with superb service).,"('FOOD',)","('LOCATION', 'NOTRELATED')"
"The neighborhood was a bit scary at first with a few rundown houses and homeless folks, but it wasn't bad at all.","('OTHER',)","('LOCATION', 'NOTRELATED')"
There is even a Trader Joe's market nearby and we got some microwaveable stuff for dinner one night and saved a TON of money.,"('LOCATION',)","('LOCATION', 'NOTRELATED')"
"We also tried the Portage Cafe down at the Watertown's sister hotel, University Inn, and while the atmosphere was pretty cool, the service was horrible (waitress was rude and apparently at the end of her shift) and the menu was mostly organic/health food so it was different from what we are used to.","('FOOD',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
"It was not bad at all, but it wasn't all that great and the prices were a bit high, in my opinion, for a college town eatery.","('OTHER',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
"My advice, skip it.The staff at the front desk was always gracious and ready to help in anyway they could.","('SERVICE',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
We used the complimentary shuttle downtown to pick-up our rental car and the driver was very kind as well.,"('SERVICE',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
"My only complaints:1) The cart system, while a great idea, was a bust for us.","('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
We tried to get the movie cart so we could watch a movie (no DVD players in the rooms) but whoever had the limited number they keep onhand did not return them while we were there so we never got one.,"('ROOMS',)","('OTHER',)"
They either need to rewrite the policy on the amount of time a cart can be kept by guests or put DVD players in all rooms.,"('ROOMS',)","('OTHER',)"
We also tried to borrow a movie from the VERY limited DVD collection only to find that the one we wanted and that they thought they had was not in the case and had likely been stolen.,"('SERVICE',)","('OTHER',)"
Bummer!,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
2) One elevator of the two was broken during our stay.,"('OTHER',)","('BUILDING',)"
"This made for VERY long waits to move between the 5 guest room floors, the lobby, and the two levels of the parking garage.","('ROOMS',)","('BUILDING',)"
3) There are no bellman so you do have to move your own luggage.,"('SERVICE',)","('SERVICE',)"
"Thankfully, they had two carts sitting by the elevators, but only two.4) There is no real drop off place in front.","('OTHER',)","('BUILDING',)"
It is on a one way street and there is no driveway or valet or anything.,"('LOCATION',)","('LOCATION', 'SERVICE')"
You just have to pull up and get dropped off.,"('NOTRELATED',)","('OTHER',)"
"At 10:15 p.m. when we arrived, there was a HUGE tractor trailer with cars on it so we couldn't even pull up in front!!!I would definitely stay here again if I wanted something a bit less expensive than the giants downtown but clean, comfy, and up-to-date just like the good guys!","('OTHER',)","('CLEANLINESS', 'NOTRELATED', 'OTHER')"

"We arrived at the hotel at 12pm, Eveyln at check in was very helpful but advised that only a room with a king size bed was available.","('ROOMS',)","('CHECKIN',)"

"It is on the second floor of a building and really is in great walking distance to the markets, ice cream stores, restaurants, the duomo, uffizi, and the accademia.","('LOCATION',)","('LOCATION',)"
We felt very secure and safe here as well.,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"

It is a three star hotel.,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
It was a very relaxing stay.,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
Hotel Metro Never Fails!,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
"There are so many things right with this hotel, starting with the location (right in the heart of mid-town, near the Empire State Bldg and Macys in a neighborhood filled with small markets, pubs ,restaurants AND right next to a subway stop) to the price, and of course the wonderful staff.","('LOCATION',)","('LOCATION', 'SERVICE', 'VALUE')"
"I particularly like the free continental b-fest of muffins, bagels, cereal and yogurt) and the free gym which I noticed was recently re-furbished.","('FOOD',)","('BUILDING', 'FOOD')"
"The bathrooms are not the biggest, nor are the rooms, but this is NY, and how much time do you spend in your room anyway?","('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
"I did notice this last time that some of the carpets/fixtures in the room were showing their age but when the price, location and staff are this welcoming, who could argue?","('SERVICE',)","('ROOMS',)"
I highly recommend Hotel Metro and will likely stay there next time I visit wonderful New York City.,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
Total Disappointment...,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
Stayed three nights at Sofitel last week.,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
We were underwhelmed with check-in.,"('CHECKIN',)","('CHECKIN',)"
First night there was no top sheet on the bed only a thin comforter.,"('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
"We called and a sheet was dropped off for us to make our bed, as there was no housekeeping staff available.","('SERVICE',)","('SERVICE',)"
"The third night, same deal, no top sheet on the bed.","('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
We were too tired to wait so we slept under the comforter that I'm guessing is not launderd after every guest - ick.,"('OTHER',)","('CLEANLINESS', 'ROOMS', 'SERVICE')"
The bed felt broken down and not anywhere near as comfortable as a Westin or Hilton bed.,"('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
"The lighting in the bathroom was horrible, it made airplane lightening look good.","('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
There were hand rails everywhere and two showers so we figured we were in a handicap room.,"('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
The windows did not open and the room was stuffy and hot.,"('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
We had to keep the air on high at the lowest temperature to make it comfortable.,"('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
The room was equiped with ONE small bottle of water and ONE robe and this continued each day.,"('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
We thought that was a little odd for a king room.,"('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
"The view was pathetic, it was like a prison view, three concrete walls and the dirty roof top.","('ROOMS',)","('LOCATION', 'ROOMS')"
I guess I had expected more since we had booked this reservation months in advance.,"('OTHER',)","('ROOMS',)"
The clock radio was not a CD player and it didn't pick up one station.,"('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
The location is miserable if you are looking for any food or toiletries.,"('FOOD',)","('LOCATION',)"
We were forced to pay $10 for a bottle of Evian in the bar one night because there is just nothing near by on foot.,"('VALUE',)","('VALUE',)"
The location is a little more than a block to the MacPherson subway station.,"('LOCATION',)","('LOCATION',)"
Be advised the subway station does not open before 7:15 a.m. on Saturday.,"('OTHER',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
The White House is about two blocks from the hotel and you certainly can't see it from the hotel.,"('LOCATION',)","('LOCATION',)"
With the subway system you are not far from anything in this town regardless where you stay.,"('OTHER',)","('LOCATION',)"
We asked the concierge if she had a map of Reagan Airports layout and she replied no.,"('SERVICE',)","('SERVICE',)"
That was pretty much the only contact we had with her.,"('ROOMS',)","('SERVICE',)"
"There is one restaurant across the street, a steakhouse, and three tourists on the street advised us not to eat there.","('FOOD',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
"There are three computers near check-in desk that are available to guests 24/7, that was very much appreciated.","('CHECKIN',)","('OTHER',)"
"However, how this hotel is ranked as high as it is, is a mystery.","('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"

"But when you arrive, the room was great.","('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
"Thoroughly modern, great views (we were on the 31st floor).","('OTHER',)","('BUILDING', 'LOCATION')"
The bed and pillows were the best I have slept in.,"('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
I asked the hotel where to buy the pillows.,"('OTHER',)","('ROOMS',)"
Only drawback was the extra charge for in-room internet.,"('ROOMS',)","('VALUE',)"
"However, the 5th floor had a number of internet terminals and most of the time we did not have to wait to use.","('SERVICE',)","('OTHER',)"
Service staff were very polite and helpful.,"('SERVICE',)","('SERVICE',)"
Was confused how to get from airport to hotel so emailed the hotel - response was fantastic with detailed maps depending on your choice of transportation.,"('OTHER',)","('NOTRELATED', 'SERVICE')"
We chose the express bus.,"('OTHER',)","('NOTRELATED',)"

Easy.,"('LOCATION',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
The hotel connected to a mall which was convenient as we ate breakfast there and had Starbucks there.,"('FOOD',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
"The mall had many restaurants, including a pretty good dim sum (recommended).","('OTHER',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
The dessert place was very good as well (also recommended).,"('FOOD',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
"The location of the hotel, while initially I had misgivings, is not too bad.","('LOCATION',)","('LOCATION',)"
Close to the Mongkok MTR so convenient.,"('LOCATION',)","('LOCATION',)"
Also close to the Mongkok East station which we took the MTR to Shenzhen for a day of shopping.,"('LOCATION',)","('LOCATION',)"
Around the hotel are many shopping places.,"('LOCATION',)","('LOCATION',)"
The street for shoes is close by as is the night market stalls.,"('LOCATION',)","('LOCATION',)"
"Also, many snack places if you like street food.","('FOOD',)","('LOCATION',)"
Simply The Best,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
Because the Hotel made a great visit to New York even better.,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
We were on the 23rd floor with a great view of the Chrysler Building.,"('ROOMS',)","('OTHER',)"
The room was a good size with ample space around the bed and a separate seating area.,"('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
The bathroom had both bath and separate walk-in shower which we consider essential.,"('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
"The non-smoking room was well presented, clean with good quality furniture, towels etc.The bed was simply the best Hotel bed we have experienced - just so comfortable.","('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
The room was serviced twice a day which meant when you dropped back to the Hotel (great location 鈥?,"('LOCATION',)","('LOCATION',)"
central but quiet) to have a midday shower (its hot and humid in July) you knew that the clean room and towels you were using would be replaced for the evening.,"('ROOMS',)","('CLEANLINESS',)"
"Best of all - all the staff are so friendly, informative and helpful.","('SERVICE',)","('SERVICE',)"
Meals were expensive compared to local eateries.,"('VALUE',)","('FOOD',)"
We choose to to eat out for three quarters of the time on the basis of cost and also to experience New Yorkers food 鈥?,"('FOOD',)","('FOOD',)"
but when we did eat in the Hotel we found the food and service excellent.,"('FOOD',)","('FOOD',)"
"It is very difficult to put into words - we have stayed in many Hotels which provide equally as good rooms, clean beds and showers, a pleasant ambiance, friendly staff and are situated in good locations.","('SERVICE',)","('NOTRELATED',)"
But being at the Sofitel just made us 鈥榝eel鈥?,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"

You will just have to try it for yourself.,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
Great location The Hotel,"('LOCATION',)","('LOCATION',)"
"Preciados is centrally located and within walking distance of the major sites in Madrid: Puerta del Sol, Teatro Opera, the Palacio Real, Catedral Almudena, etc.","('LOCATION',)","('LOCATION',)"

"The hotel decor is very tasteful and trendy, and while the wallpaper may need a tiny bit of work here and there, as has been mentioned before, its really not a big deal.","('BUILDING',)","('BUILDING',)"

Relocated to Ohana East This property is now a part of the Ohana and Outrigger family of hotels.,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
This is initially why I booked with them.,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
"However, they overbooked the property when I got there and would only accomodate me in a smoking environment.","('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
This surprised me since Ohana has some completely non smoking properties.,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"
I thought they were updating their standards.,"('OTHER',)","('OTHER',)"

I finally got the attention of a young gentleman (Alex) to see the obvious which is just to find me a comparable room with their other properties.,"('ROOMS',)","('SERVICE',)"
It was so easy but the other women at the front desk were horrible on helping anyone and even one tried to be confrontational.,"('SERVICE',)","('SERVICE',)"

The worst thing we encountered was the number of panhandlers downtown and at the wharf.,"('FOOD',)","('NOTRELATED',)"

"A tiny desk was provided which contained a coffee maker, the ice bucket (along with a few drinks that were for sale) and was also meant to be used as a work space.","('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
It was not really useful for anything due to its size and number of functions that it was supposed to perform.,"('ROOMS',)","('ROOMS',)"
