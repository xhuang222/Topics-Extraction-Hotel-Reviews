The worst thing we encountered was the number of panhandlers downtown and at the wharf.,['NOTRELATED']

We thought a better idea would have been to park at one of the all night parking lots in the French Quarter for $10 to save $$$$.,['NOTRELATED']

So for most people who are not social anxiety-prone this would not be a problem but instead a plus.,['OTHER']
