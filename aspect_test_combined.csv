The hotel public areas and rooms are lovely; breakfast is good; and happy hour is just the thing after a day of exploring Florence!,BUILDING
"However, the best part is the care you receive from Fabrizio and Tommaso from the moment you book the reservation and ask for touring help, to check in and out, to dinner and musuem reservations while you are there.",CHECKIN
It feels like you are staying at a friend's home where they are glad to see you and want you to love their home and city!,SERVICE
Excellent location Excellent location for main shopping areas and good for using public transport to other parts of the city and airport.,LOCATION
"The room we were allocated was on the 5th floor, facing other buildings - not a view at all but lovely and quiet for sleeping.",ROOMS
The room was bigger than we expected after reading the reviews and along with the bathroom was very clean.,CLEANLINESS
After reporting the loss of a key ( no problems with reception thank goodness!),CHECKIN
we moved to another room which was much smaller but okay for the short time we spent in it.Internet access was free with a guest computer in the reception's library area - this was great but if you use please remember that the person who is using may just have logged on before you arrived.,OTHER
Only down side was with the luxury breakfast - we had real problems getting a seat and juice.,OTHER
Lack of service and nightlife,SERVICE
I soon discovered things were a bit different.,OTHER
"First, the resort is about an hour from the international airport in Isla Verde and transportation is not included to and from the hotel ($120 round trip for 2 adults).",OTHER
"The building and the bungalows are very pretty as well as the pool area and the mountain view (it's the rain forest called Yunque that can be seen from the pool area) sadly, the outdoor lobby where the main desk is located is just simply too hot, I was sweating heavy while waiting in line to be checked in (also long line at check out since express check out from room TV was not available) and nobody offered us any refreshment or water, also the desk agents did not look very happy to be working in those conditions.",BUILDING
A la carte restaurants need reservations in advance and if the place is crowded you won't be able to get any reservation during the whole stay.,FOOD
I had a good dinner at Bamboo (japanese) one night but was not able to get in for the rest of my stay.,FOOD
The buffet style restaurants( Caribeno and Toscano) are disappointing to say the least.,FOOD
"The main bar was enjoyable and the bartenders gave good service while a lady sang spanish songs, enjoyed that very much and tasted a bit of the national culture talking to locals and watching them dance but this was the only nightlife the hotel offered since they have no live bands or dance club.",OTHER
"My biggest complaint was lack of service, employees looked overworked and unhappy, all areas looked understaffed.",SERVICE
Concierge was never available during the evening and the front desk was too overwhelmed with guests unable to help us at any time.,CHECKIN
There is no free shuttle bus to Luquillo Beach which is about 10 minutes from the resort and simply mediocre nightlife inside the resort and not much too do in the municipality or province of Rio Grande where the resort is located (you have no choice but to pay a taxi $140 to enjoy San Juan's exciting nightlife ).,SERVICE
don't waste your money!!!,OTHER
"Service was terrible, staff were grumpy and very unpolite. the room was so small that we hardly managed to move around.",ROOMS
they put us in a room for 2 and got two other beds from some other room.,ROOMS
no room service and prices for drinks were doubled in price.,SERVICE
a soft drink was priced at 3Euro.,VALUE
you can buy drinks from outside the hotel for l.60 euro. bed sheets were never changed during that week and room was never cleaned.,CLEANLINESS

"Convenient, solid, would stay again",OTHER
"A good, solid, basic HI Express hotel right in the heart of Hollywood.",OTHER
Had to get a room for a wedding in Hollywood and this property was available in what I knew was a relatively safe location and was at a reasonable price (direct from HI website).,LOCATION
"Location: First off, Hollywood itself isn't a real nice place to stay - it's sketchy in several areas and not necessarily what many out-of-towners might picture.",LOCATION

"Room: Very clean, still had a 'newly built' smell and feel to it, which was nice.",ROOMS

The service lady who managed the area did a great job of keeping it clean and prepped.,CLEANLINESS

We couldn't hear the traffic.,ROOMS
"But the street the hotel is on is a *main* street, constantly busy - so consider this when checking in.All in all, I'd stay here again easily and can recommend it to families with kids, tourists of any age or anyone looking for a place to stay when coming up for an event at the Bowl (which is literally walking distance from the hotel).",OTHER
"Warning, they falsely charged my CC WARNING!",OTHER
"After reading ALL of the horrible online reviews of St Vincents Guest House AND hearing a first hand account from a friend who encountered condoms in the hall/stairs, bugs in their bed, urine and other questionable fluids on the walls, we CANCELLED our reservation with several weeks notice.",CLEANLINESS
"NOW, today I received my credit card bill and found that this place falsely charged my credit card for a stay!",VALUE

Only one thing the shower doesn't have a lot of hot water - the water was just warm enough to have a shower but not comfortably warm.,ROOMS

It is possible to walk to the nearest station but it will not be that comfortable if you have luggage with you.,LOCATION
The hotel is located in the middle of the hill which makes walking not too easy.,LOCATION
"Apart from that, it is not too far from the city centre and the neighbourhood of the hotel is quite pleasant too.I've got the harbou view room which was nice, even though the view wasn't as spectecular as that in the city centre.",LOCATION

"I had spent two nights at the Hotel 1898 on Las Ramblas before checking in to the CF, and although a night in a Standard room at the CF was 110 Euro a night more expensive than a Superior room at the 1898, the CF truly is in a different class than the 1898 and is worth the extra money.I should say however that a local travel agent quoted me a rate of Euro 240/night inclusive of breakfast at the CF for the weekend of November 17th, but I ended up having to change my travel dates due to work.",VALUE
"Obviously, it would have been great to get the cheaper rate, but I would pay the higher rate again for a chance to stay at the Casa Fuster where the service and the accommodations are truly top notch.",OTHER

"Still, this lobby was crowded in the way I enjoy so I cannot fault it Although I expected the Standard room at the CF to smaller than the superior room at the 1898, the room at the CF had a very, very large, luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent of the bathroom at the Hotel de Russie in Rome.",ROOMS

A top choice in Barcelona,OTHER
"I had spent two nights at the Hotel 1898 on Las Ramblas before checking in to the CF, and although a night in a Standard room at the CF was 110 Euro a night more expensive than a Superior room at the 1898, the CF truly is in a different class than the 1898 and is worth the extra money.I should say however that a local travel agent quoted me a rate of Euro 240/night inclusive of breakfast at the CF for the weekend of November 17th, but I ended up having to change my travel dates due to work.",VALUE

"Skeptics might say that a small gesture like that is not worth the extra Euro 110/night over my other choice for accommodation, but to me it makes all the difference.I did eventually make my way to the lobby bar after midnight where I enjoyed a glass of Cava, finger foods, and deserts.",FOOD

Let mention that I have a love-hate relationship with large hotels.,NOTRELATED

with bellhops coming and going and groups congregating all over the lobby was 鈥渘ow this is a real hotel鈥?,OTHER
"I would say that the CF and the 1898 are of similar size, but the lobby of the CF was much more lively than the 1898 although they both had high occupancy during my stay.",BUILDING

I think the bathroom is the most important part of a hotel room and would gladly give up extra room real estate if it would buy me a larger bathroom.,ROOMS
You could comfortably fit two people in this bathroom which I appreciated even though I was traveling alone.,ROOMS
In fact the entire CF reminded me of a smaller version of the de Russie.,OTHER

My wife and I stayed at the Dia-Ichi Hotel Tokyo during the last week of July 2006.,NOTRELATED

"The Dai-Ichi Hotel Tokyo is across the street from the Shimbashi train station (there is actually an underground connection), which in addition to a couple of subway lines also has the Yamanote JR train line which is great for getting to the various sights (the Yamanote line is a circle line that runs around central Tokyo and is covered by the JR rail pass).",LOCATION
This means that if you are coming in from Narita airport all your have to do is take the Narita Express to Tokyo Station and then get on the Yamanote line and travel two stops to Shimbashi.,LOCATION
"In addition to great transportation, there are also numerous restaurants and coffee shops in the surrounding streets, including a full supermarket in the Shimbashi station.",LOCATION
"As has also been mentioned, the hotel is only a 15 minute walk to the fish market which is very handy as the action there starts before the subway begin operation in the morning.",LOCATION
The hotel itself was very nice; equivalent to a 4-star business hotel in North America with well appointed and relatively spacious rooms.,BUILDING
The staff were very helpful and there always seemed to be at least one staff member available at all time who spoke English.,SERVICE
We got a very good price for this hotel on Expedia (CAD$160/night) - a price/quality combination that we would be hard pressed to match in any North American hotel.,VALUE
