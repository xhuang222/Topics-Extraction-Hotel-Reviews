The other thing...[and I feel awful having to say this because nobody else has] ...is that breakfast was a little uncomfortable [ bit too intimate! ],['OTHER']
as we had to keep sharing a table with someone because the room was so tiny [ a converted cellar I think] and there was a maximum number of tables- so if everyone came down at once in the morning it would be chaos!!!,['BUILDING']
The lady waitress was a bit slow on the uptake and didnt understand much of what we were saying but we just didnt let it get to us.Nevertheless this hotel is good value for money and I agree with most of the comments made and the manager has done his best to make sure nobody has a bad time.,"['SERVICE', 'VALUE']"

This was not the case and we were charged $13 a day for the privelege.,['VALUE']
During our time in the States we had stayed at other more basic hotels which offered free wifi in rooms.,['OTHER']

"I had spent two nights at the Hotel 1898 on Las Ramblas before checking in to the CF, and although a night in a Standard room at the CF was 110 Euro a night more expensive than a Superior room at the 1898, the CF truly is in a different class than the 1898 and is worth the extra money.I should say however that a local travel agent quoted me a rate of Euro 240/night inclusive of breakfast at the CF for the weekend of November 17th, but I ended up having to change my travel dates due to work.",['VALUE']

"Still, this lobby was crowded in the way I enjoy so I cannot fault it Although I expected the Standard room at the CF to smaller than the superior room at the 1898, the room at the CF had a very, very large, luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent of the bathroom at the Hotel de Russie in Rome.",['ROOMS']
You could comfortably fit two people in this bathroom which I appreciated even though I was traveling alone.,['ROOMS']
I did have a minor problem with the shower éˆ¥?,['ROOMS']

Let mention that I have a love-hate relationship with large hotels.,['NOTRELATED']
I like the hustle and bustle of crowded lobbies and get kind of depressed when I am staying at smaller boutique hotels that have empty-ghost town lobbies.,['NOTRELATED']

Guess you cant have the crowded lobby without the obligatory tour bus parked outside.,['NOTRELATED']
"Still, this lobby was crowded in the way I enjoy so I cannot fault it Although I expected the Standard room at the CF to smaller than the superior room at the 1898, the room at the CF had a very, very large, luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent of the bathroom at the Hotel de Russie in Rome.",['ROOMS']
I think the bathroom is the most important part of a hotel room and would gladly give up extra room real estate if it would buy me a larger bathroom.,['ROOMS']

Thankfully the CF was everything I expected éˆ¥?,['OTHER']
actually better b/c it surpassed the 1898 éˆ¥?,['OTHER']
But I would explain the stellar reviews that the 1898 gets by saying that it probably exceeds peopleéˆ¥æªš expectations as a 4 star hotel while it sounds like the CF sometimes does not live up to peopleéˆ¥æªš expectations.,['NOTRELATED']

"How could they forget to utilize the best amenity they have, and charge dearly for: the stellar views!",['NOTRELATED']
It must be reserved for hotel guests (no less than one nights stay is the cost of admission to what is probably one of the most spectacular vistas in the Mediterranean).,['NOTRELATED']
